      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies. This Cookie Policy explains how
        we use cookies in connection with the Platform and your related choices.
        Capitalized terms used in this Cookie Policy but not defined here will
        have the meanings given to them in our Privacy Policy. You may also
        contact us at{' '}

        any additional questions.

      <h2>What are Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you
        browse the web. Like many commercial websites, we use cookies. Cookies —
        and similar technologies — do lots of different jobs, like letting you
        navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and
        generally improving the user experience. Cookies and other technologies
        may also be used to measure the effectiveness of marketing and otherwise
        assist us in making your use of the Platform and its features more
        relevant and useful to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pixel tags (also known as web beacons or pixels) are small blocks of
        code on a web page or in an email notification. Pixels allow companies
        to collect information such as an individual's IP address, when the
        individual viewed the pixel and the type of browser used. We use pixel
        tags to understand whether you've interacted with content on our
        Platform, which helps us measure and improve our Platform and
        personalize your experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local storage allows a website to store information locally on your
        computer or mobile device. Local storage is mainly used to store and
        retrieve data in HTML pages from the same domain. We use local storage
        to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with our
        Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to understand that cookies (and the technologies listed
        above) collect personal information as well as non-identifiable
        information.
      </p>
      <h2>How and Why do We Use Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        We use both 1st party cookies (which are set by us) and 3rd party
        cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our
        Site). Some of the cookies or similar technologies that we use are
        "strictly necessary" in that they are essential to the Site. Without
        them, the Site will not work. Other cookies or similar technologies,
        while not essential, help us improve our Platform or measure audiences.
        Why we use cookies is describe below in more detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strictly Necessary or Essential Cookies: These cookies are necessary for
        the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. For

        during a browsing session. We have to load essential cookies for
        legitimate interests pursued by us in delivering our Site's essential
        functionality to you.

        functionality improves user experience and enables us to provide better
        Services and a more efficient Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performance and Analytics Cookies: These cookies allow us to count
        visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance
        of our Site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least
        popular and see how visitors navigate the Site. Performance cookies are
        used to help us with our analytics, including to compile statistics and
        analytics about your use of and interaction with the Site, including
        details about how and where our Site are accessed, how often you visit
        or use the Site, the date and time of your visits, your actions on the
        Site, and other similar traffic, usage, and trend data.
