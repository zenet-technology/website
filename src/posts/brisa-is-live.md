title: 'Brisa public release: Why do we want to use Brisa?'
description: Brisa is a modern web framework that simplifies the complexity of SSR with a focus on web-components. It clearly defines server and client data flows using the power of signals. With minimal overhead and a straightforward structure, Brisa has a minimal learning curve, high efficiency, and a clear approach to data management.

It has been one year since Aral Roca first shared with us his vision of building a new web framework — what would eventually become Brisa. Back then, it didn’t even have a name yet. But Aral had a clear idea of what he wanted: to learn by creating, and to gain a deeper understanding of how signals work using web components and server-side rendering (SSR).

At Zenet Technology, we started playing around with Brisa from version 0.0.30 — more than 200 versions ago! Since then, we’ve provided feedback to the Brisa team and even contributed a few small pieces ourselves.

## Why would a developer or a company want to start using Brisa?

- **Clearly Defined Components:** Brisa separates server and web components without needing to specify use server or use client, simplifying things and removing unnecessary overhead.
- **Web Standards Compliance:** Brisa follows web standards as closely as possible, which means developers don’t have to learn new, proprietary concepts.
- **Effortless Data Flow:** There’s no confusion about what data is server-side (private) or client-side, and Brisa provides a seamless way to share it across components.
- **Trust in the Authors:** It’s driven by a genuine desire to make the web a better place, and that’s something you can get behind.
- **Innovation and Curiosity:** Brisa combines cutting-edge concepts like Web Components, SSR, and signals in an exciting way.
- **Native App Development:** With Tauri v2 integration, you can create native apps using Brisa with just a single command.
- **Future-Proof:** Web Components are a key part of the web’s future, and Brisa is built on this foundation.
- **Easy to Learn:** Brisa’s learning curve is short, making it accessible even to developers who are new to the web component ecosystem.

## Why would a developer or a company want to hold back from using Brisa?

- **Developer Experience Still Evolving:** Brisa’s DX is still a work in progress, and while it’s improving, it’s not quite on par with more established frameworks.
- **Small, Growing Community:** The community is still small and support currently relies on a core group of contributors, which might make it slower to find answers when you’re stuck.

## Conclusion

Even though Brisa is currently at version 0.1 (still a very early stage) we feel confident in saying it’s ready for small to mid-sized projects today. We believe Brisa has the potential to handle larger applications in the near future, thanks to the hard work and big ambitions of the Brisa team.

At Zenet Technology, we’ve successfully built two small projects and one mid-sized project using Brisa. It’s been a really busy year, but an exciting one!
