Zenet Technology's website has received an important update. You might not have noticed the change, but over the past few months, we have been collaborating with @aralroca to support his new framework called ‚ÄúBrisa,‚Äù and we have implemented it on our website. This new framework will be publicly available in September 2024, with the exact date to be defined, in its version 0.1. It will use BunJS, and we at Zenet Technology will be actively supporting it.

We have had the pleasure of being the first to work with Brisa framework, and we are committed to mastering every aspect of it to support new businesses in onboarding this amazing technology yet to be uncovered.

Brisa was inspired by BunJS, NextJS, React, Preact, SolidJS, VueJS, Qwik, Lit, HTMLx, and Tauri, incorporating all the incredible innovations these technologies have developed over the years. It features:

- ‚öõÔ∏è Everything you need: JSX, TS, server/web components, server actions, optimistic updates, SSR, streaming, suspense, signals, websockets, middleware, layouts, and so on...
- üöÄ Speed: Brisa is designed to start, build, test, deploy and run fast.
- üåç i18n support: text translation and routing carrying only the translations you consume.
- üì¶ Tiny: 0B by default, 2kB when you use server actions (RPC size), and 3kb when you need web components.
- üì≤ Change the output: You can change your web from server to static, to desktop, android or ios app with just one configuration command.

Thanks to these features, Brisa is a lightning-fast framework that provides everything you need to run your application.

It comes with a unified developer experience and an opinioneted project structure which allows the framework to be smart enough to build everything you want and make it to work with just a few commands.

The first version will only work with BunJS for SSR or for static pages will run everywhere. We will be providing a very complete documentation and examples for you to start using it as easy as it could, even with no support to NodeJS.

No panic yet we only support BunJS because it is in the roadmap to support other platforms on the way to the version 1. Version 1 will be runtime agnostic, deploy it everywhere. It will be a very experimental framework for a while, but we are here to support.

Stay tunned for more updates, meanwhile you can follow @aralroca, who is actively posting fragments of code and more development status.
